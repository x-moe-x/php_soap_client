Orders:
	OrderHead	identified by OrderID
	OrderItem[]	identified by ?, contains OrderID
	several other stuff currently considered unimportant

store Orders in db:
	get orders page by page:
	1.	check if order changed since last update
	2.	if so (or if it's a new order): update/store order in db, identified by it's OrderID
	3.	delete all corresponding OrderItem in OrderItem table
	4.	store all OrterItems in db

necesary: meta-table to store lastupdate timestamps
implement robust behaviour for not-yet-existing functions
