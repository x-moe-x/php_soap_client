Orders:
	OrderHead	identified by OrderID
	OrderItem[]	identified by ?, contains OrderID
	several other stuff currently considered unimportant

store Orders in db:
	get orders page by page:
	1.	check if order changed since last update
	2.	if so (or if it's a new order): update/store order in db, identified by it's OrderID
	3.	delete all corresponding OrderItems in OrderItem table
	4.	store all OrterItems in db
	
	(5.	to get needed AttributeValueSets request them after processing the orders all at one)
	
store AttributeValueSets in db:
	1.	check if current AttributeValueSet already exists in db
	2.	if not start a request and store it

implement robust behaviour for not-yet-existing functions
OrderItem.ItemText is too small
