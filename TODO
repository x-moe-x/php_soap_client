Orders:
	OrderHead	identified by OrderID
	OrderItem[]	identified by ?, contains OrderID
	several other stuff currently considered unimportant

store Orders in db:
	get orders page by page:
	1.	check if order changed since last update
	2.	if so (or if it's a new order): update/store order in db, identified by it's OrderID
	3.	delete all corresponding OrderItem in OrderItem table
	4.	store all OrterItems in db
	1.	Store OrderHead in db
	2.	Store OrderItems in db	<- how to identify those items so they don't get stuffed in the db multiple times?

necesary: meta-table to store lastupdate timestamps
